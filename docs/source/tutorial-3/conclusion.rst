What have we done
----------------------
In this tutorial we have looked at how to structure your code to work with Reconfigure.io, and how to use our template as a basis for writing new programs. Also, we've seen how to pass arguments straight from the host to the FPGA using the control register, and pass data from the host to the FPGA via shared memory, and back again. Next, we'll look at a few ways to :ref:`optimize <optimize>` your Reconfigure.io programs.
