Build reports
=============
Once a build is complete you can access a report to find out how much of the FPGA's available resources are being used by your design. In this section we'll cover the following:

* How to view reports
* The structure of reports â€“ highlighting key useful elements
* A look at what each component of the FPGA does and how your code translates to those resources
* Pointers to using these reports to optimize your code

---------------------
Build reports are generated when a build completes successfully, and the information they contain is broken down into the various elements that make up the FPGA: Configurable logic blocks, DSP blocks and RAM.
