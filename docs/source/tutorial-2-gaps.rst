    Run ``reco update`` to check your version and update if required. The current version of our command line tool is |reco_version|.

We are going to look at pretty much the simplest calculation possible – adding two numbers together. First, we will look at the problem, discuss how to design the program, and have a go at filling in the gaps in some incomplete code. **The last tutorial was all about workflow, so now we're taking the first step towards writing and debugging your own programs.**

What we will do
----------------
* :ref:`Look <problem>` at a possible solution for a simple addition problem
* :ref:`Fork <fork>` our tutorial materials repo
* :ref:`Fill <gaps>` in the gaps in our incomplete code example
* :ref:`Test <test-addiiton>` your complete code in your Go environment
* :ref:`Check <check-addition>` the code for compatibility with the Reconfigure.io compiler and simulate running the code on an FPGA
* :ref:`Compare <solution>` your code with ours

This tutorial assumes you have already run through our first tutorial: :ref:`demo`.
