Program FPGAs with Go!
=======================

Reconfigure.io brings the power of hardware-acceleration technology to the cloud ecosystem. Whatever industry you work in, it's likely that speed and cost are important factors in your work. Increasing CPU speeds have long been the way towards improvements in these areas, but like many things, this can't last forever.

FPGA-based hardware acceleration, whilst nothing new, provides significant speed improvements through carrying out many, many tasks in parallel. Cost reductions are easily achieved due to the fact that one FPGA can carry out the work of many servers. Up until now, the power of the FPGA has been tricky to harness due to the skills and hardware required to take full advantage of their programmability. Reconfigure.io allows you to use the skills and tools you have already to program and reprogram FPGAs to fit your business-specific requirements, all from a powerful, convenient and easy to use cloud deployment and management system.

**We've simplified the path to developing for FPGAs – now all you need is a laptop.**


How to use this guide
----------------------

Switching from software development to hardware programming involves changing the way you think about and approach problems, not to mention the different tooling and skill requirements. Reconfigure.io provides a comfortable platform for you to make this change.

You can start off by running through our :ref:`first tutorial <demo>` to see how powerful the Reconfigure.io service is. Through this you will get to grips with our simple workflow, you will use some of our example code to run through checking, simulating, building and finally deploying a program to an FPGA. Next, our :ref:`second tutorial <addition>` looks at a very simple example and guides you through completing some code for yourself to give you more experience of how our programs are structured. The :ref:`third tutorial <structure>` looks at program structure in more detail, as well as exploring how data is shared between the various elements of the cloud-based hardware – This puts you in a good position to start writing your own programs. Our :ref:`fourth tutorial <graphstutorial>` guides you through optimizing your programs for the FPGA architecture.

You can access technical support from our engineering team at any time, we're always available on the `community forum <https://community.reconfigure.io/>`_ if you need us!

Along the way, you may want to read a little more about a particular aspect of the Reconfigure.io service. For this, there is an :ref:`overview <overview>` section with clear descriptions of each stage of the workflow as well as details of system architecture to help you conceptualize what’s happening throughout the process.
