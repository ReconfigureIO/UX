Release Notes
=============

Reconfigure.io v0.17.6
======================

This is a bugfix release focussed on enabling some in-house product tests.

bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
* If a vendored version of our `xcl <https://godoc.org/github.com/ReconfigureIO/sdaccel/xcl>`_ is provided, this is now given priority over our host-side code.
* The default `xcl <https://godoc.org/github.com/ReconfigureIO/sdaccel/xcl>`_ library has been updated to include fixes for a segfault and to allow memory proceed to run while a kernel is running.

Reconfigure.io v0.17.5
======================

This is a bugfix release focussed on fixing unintended side-effects of some recent compiler optimizations.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed an edge case in our latch scheduling algorithm where many serial forks would not introduce a latch, causing timing to fail. Thanks to `foolmarks <https://community.reconfigure.io/u/foolmarks/summary>`_ on our forums for reporting the bug!
* Refined an optimization rule to prevent it from removing necessary control flow.

Reconfigure.io v0.17.4
======================

This release delivers significant performance improvements through simplifying logic and the way we handle constants. The result is faster and smaller arithmetic and logic operations, improved latch removal, and the ability to have multiple operators per clock cycle.

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Simplified adjacent constants â€“ two constants that are joined together will now be a single constant.
* Changes to priorities for latch removal in order to remove more.
* An entirely new cost system for latch removal based upon FPGA timing delay, along with reworked operators that allow them to complete in partial cycles, allowing simple arithmetic like ``(a + 1) < b`` to happen in a single cycle.

Reconfigure.io v0.17.3
======================

This is a performance focused release that includes some bugfixes related to larger applications

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Reworked multipliers to use fewer pipeline stages, improving performance
* Optimize control flow around some channel operations
* Optimize expressions like n < 0 to just check the sign bit.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix an issue with some module names being too long for Vivado
* Fix an issue where reco.yml files using Windows line ending were not being parsed correctly

Reconfigure.io v0.17.2
======================

This is a bugfix release focussed on graph generation.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed a bug in our optimization rules which lead to some graphs being incorrectly generated.

Reconfigure.io v0.17.1
======================

This release adds support for increased memory access bandwidth, from 64 bit to 512 bit, when using the new SMI infrastructure. This will provide a performance gain when using read/write burst memory transactions. See an example application using SMI `here <https://github.com/ReconfigureIO/examples/tree/master/histogram-array-SMI>`_.

API docs
~~~~~~~~~

A draft version of our SMI API docs is now available.

* `SMI docs <https://godoc.org/github.com/ReconfigureIO/sdaccel/smi>`_

Features
~~~~~~~~

* You can now set memory read/write bandwidth to 512 bit.

Reconfigure.io v0.17.0
======================

This release adds initial support for our new memory infrastructure, called SMI (Scalable Multiprotocol Infrastructure).

SMI
~~~

Our engineers have developed SMI to provide improvements to the way we give memory access to FPGAs. Improvements through using SMI include:

* Easier to scale up projects to use available memory bandwidth.
* Increase in available bandwidth across multiple goroutines.
* Simplified code, less boilerplate.

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Further optimize some variable and channel concurrency operations.
* Reduce verbose log output during synthesis.

Reconfigure.io v0.16.4
======================

This is a minor release focused on improving performance for generated code, and fixing a bug in our `sdaccel <https://github.com/ReconfigureIO/sdaccel>`_ support.

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Reduce the cost of functions calls.
* Optimize some variable and channel concurrency operations.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix an issue in code generation where the ``ReadBurst`` memory functions could lock up when the consumer was too slow.

Reconfigure.io v0.16.3
======================

This is a bugfix release fixing generated code causing a crash in some vendor tooling.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Altered the representation of BRAM initilization constants to prevent segfaults during synthesis.


Reconfigure.io v0.16.2
======================

This is a bugfix release targeting bugs in consecutive channel reads and graph generation.

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Optimized code generation in the case of consecutive channel reads, reducing the size of the resulting circuit on the FPGA.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a bug which caused graph generation to crash.
* Fixed a bug in code generation where consecutive channel reads would result in code that would not build on FPGAs.


Reconfigure.io v0.16.0
======================

In this release, we have open sourced our Go libraries that were previously included as part of the build process. This allows for better integration with local tooling.

* `Repository <https://github.com/ReconfigureIO/sdaccel>`_
* `GoDoc <https://godoc.org/github.com/ReconfigureIO/sdaccel>`_

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

This upgrade is purely an opt-in process. The previous packages will continue to work.

If you'd like to upgrade, we provide a `tool to automigrate your code <https://github.com/ReconfigureIO/sdaccel/cmd/fix>`_. Run it like so::

  $ go install github.com/ReconfigureIO/sdaccel/cmd/fix
  # In your project directory
  $ fix .

You'll also need to use `Go's vendor mechanism <https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2015/vendor-folder/>`_ to vendor the version of our tools you'd like to use. We recommend using `Glide <http://glide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/>`_ to manage the vendor folder::

  $ glide create --non-interactive
  $ glide install
  $ ls vendor/github.com/ReconfigureIO/sdaccel
  axi  cmd  control  LICENSE  Makefile  stubs  verilog  xcl  framework.go  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  README.md  docker-compose.yml


Features
~~~~~~~~

* Our compiler now supports multiple function arguments with the same type, of the form: ``func myFunction(a, b, c int)``

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* The compiler now correctly typechecks arguments to functions.

  Previously, some types with equal representation would be allowed (e.g. ``uint`` and ``uint32``) interchangably as arguments to a function call. This fixes that, and improves error messages in the cases that were already covered.


Reconfigure.io v0.15.0
======================

This release marks our public beta! We're tremendously excited to put the
Reconfigure.io product out into the world. In addition, this release contains
performance tweaks that will improve the speed of much real-world code.

API Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `host docs <http://godoc.reconfigure.io/v0.15.0/host/pkg>`_

Features
~~~~~~~~

* The compiler now supports an optimization known as operator pipelining. Whenever the compiler encounters
  a loop that processes data arithmetically, it converts that loop into a highly-efficient pipeline on the
  FPGA, during which one piece of data may allow a subsequent piece of data to start before the current
  datum has finished processing. Parallel stages are balanced through latch insertion. This provides
  drastic speedups to any program that features looped processing of data.
* We have adjusted the optimization rules to take advantage of highly-pipelined programs.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Bugs in on-chip SELF components have been fixed.
* Potential inefficiencies when mixing constants and variables in arithmetic operators have been removed.

  through the ``reco-jarvice`` command line tool.

Language Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Reconfigure.io tooling and compiler are in an alpha state. Though our offering is polished enough to get real-world tasks done, there are as of yet some rough edges and incompatibilities. These will all be addressed in subsequent releases, and we appreciate your patience in the meantime.

A core part of the language is supported, including functions,
methods, and primitive operators. The following limitations apply in this release:

No Multiply or Divide
---------------------

You may be able to work around this limitation through bitshifts and repeated addition.

Large arrays cause problems
---------------------------

Depending on the underlying type, arrays of more than length 64 may
result in code that cannot be run on an FPGA. To work around this, use
the memory interface.

Order of Declaration Matters
----------------------------

You can't use a function that's declared later than it's used in your
code. To work around this, only use a function or method after it's
declared.

Libraries
---------

Most libraries will not work on FPGAs. If this interferes with your vision, please let us know which libraries you'd like to see supported by the Reconfigure.io tooling and compiler.

No Floating Point
-----------------

The alpha release does not support IEEE-754 floating point operations, as expressing IEEE-754 on an FPGA is a nontrivial problem. This will be addressed in future releases!

No Maps or Interfaces
---------------------

You may be able to work around the lack of maps with judicious use of arrays.

Static channels
---------------
Channels must be statically resolvable at compile time. In this case,
you may bind a channel to a name only once. The following code will error::

  func badChannelUsage(){
       c := make(chan int)
       b = c
  }

No Pointers or Slices
---------------------

Pointers & slices are not supported. Some slice usage can be replaced by arrays.



Tool Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build, simulations & running jobs are limited to a 2 hour timeout.

Tooling only supports 'Jarvice' provider. In future ``reco-jarvice`` will be replaced with ``reco`` which will support multiple cloud providers.
